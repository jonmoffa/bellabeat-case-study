# Bellabeat Case Study: README

Determining trends with smart device usage

## Overview

The goal of this case study is to determine trends with smart device usage, and to use insights gained from those trends to improve the user experience. In doing so, this will highlight some opportunities for growth within the company.

## Business Understanding

Bellabeat offers several products to remain competitive in the smart device market, including an app, several types of wellness trackers, and a subscription service. It is important to understand how users are engaging with these products in order to ensure that users are getting the best experience possible and to uncover new opportunities for company growth.

## Data Understanding

The data used for this case study was collected from about thirty consenting FitBit users, and includes various metrics for physical activity, as well as weight, sleep, and heart rate data. The original data can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/record/53894#.YMoUpnVKiP9).

## Evaluation

Analysis during the completion of this case study revealed several findings, which can be summarized below:

- There were many positive correlations uncovered between many of the physical activity health metrics, such as step count, calories burned, daily total distance (miles), and very active distance (the distance traveled where the user was very active).
- The rate of very active distance (miles) increased more sharply when step count continued to increase, indicating a relationship between high step counts and longer very active distances.
- When examining sleep data, a relationship was uncovered between getting less sleep and spending extra time in bed. Additionally, those who got less sleep and spent extra time in bed tended to burn fewer calories.

## Conclusion

Based on the findings above, several actions were recommended to Bellabeat to determine the next steps of the company. For one, Bellabeat could enable users to set goals for physical activity, which can encourage walking more or increasing high-intensity exercise, to burn more calories. Additionally, Bellabeat could use the findings to optimize their membership subscription service.
